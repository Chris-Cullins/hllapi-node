hllapi-node
===========

A HLLAPI wrapper in Node.js for interacting with a 3270 terminal emulator

Note: Since most (probably all) hllapi.dlls that come with terminal emulators are compiled as 32-bit load libraries, you will need a 32-install of Node.js to run hllapi-node properly. Just a heads up!
